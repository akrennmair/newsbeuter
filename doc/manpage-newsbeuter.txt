NAME
----
newsbeuter - an RSS/Atom feed reader for text terminals


SYNOPSIS
--------
'newsbeuter' [-r] [-e] [-i opmlfile] [-u urlfile] [-c cachefile] [-C configfile] [-X] [-o] [-x <command> ...] [-h]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'newsbeuter' is an RSS/Atom feed reader for text terminals. RSS and Atom are a 
number of widely-used XML formats to transmit, publish and syndicate articles, 
for example news or blog articles.  Newsbeuter is designed to be used on text 
terminals on Unix or Unix-like systems such as Linux, BSD or Mac OS X.


OPTIONS
-------
-h, --help::
        Display help

-r, --refresh-on-start::
        Refresh feeds on start

-e, --export-to-opml::
        Export feeds as OPML to stdout

-X, --vacuum::
        Clean up cache thoroughly (i.e. reduce it in size if possible)

-v, -V, --version::
        Get version information about newsbeuter and the libraries it uses

-i opmlfile, --import-from-opml=opmlfile::
       Import an OPML file

-H homedir, --home-dir=homedir::
       Use an alternative home directory, individual files can be overridden using -u, -c and -C as described bellow.

-u urlfile, --url-file=urlfile::
       Use an alternative URL file

-c cachefile, --cache-file=cachefile::
       Use an alternative cache file

-C configfile, --config-file=configfile::
       Use an alternative configuration file

-x command ..., --execute=command...::
       Execute one or more commands to run newsbeuter unattended. Currently available
       commands are "reload" and "print-unread".

-o, --offline-mode::
       Active offline reading mode. When Google Reader synchronization mode is configured,
       then the list of feeds will not be loaded from Google Reader, but instead from
       the local cache. This makes it possible to read locally cached articles even
       without internet connection to connect to Google Reader.

-l loglevel, --log-level=loglevel::
       Generate a logfile with a certain loglevel. Valid loglevels are 1 to 6. An
       actual logfile will only be written when you provide a logfile name.

-d logfile, --log-file=logfile::
       Use this logfile as output when logging debug messages. Please note that this
       only works when providing a loglevel.

-E file, --export-to-file=file::
       Export a list of read articles (resp. their GUIDs). This can be used to
       transfer information about read articles between different computers.

-I file, --import-from-file=file::
      Import a list of read articles and mark them as read if they are held in the
      cache. This is to be used in conjunction with the -E commandline parameter.
