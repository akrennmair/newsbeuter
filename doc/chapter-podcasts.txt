A podcast is a media file distributed over the internet using syndication feeds
such as RSS, for later playback on portable players or computers.  Newsbeuter
contains support for downloading and saving podcasts. This support differs a bit
from other podcast aggregators or "podcatchers" in how it is done.

Podcast content is transported in RSS feeds via special tags called
"enclosures". Newsbeuter recognizes these enclosures and stores the relevant
information for every podcast item it finds in an RSS feed. Since version 2.0,
it also recognizes and handles the Yahoo Media RSS extensions. What the user
then can do is to add the podcast download URL to a download queue.
Alternatively, newsbeuter can be configured to automatically do that. This
queue is stored in the file $HOME/.local/share/newsbeuter/queue.

The user can then use the download manager "podbeuter" to download these files
to a directory on the local filesystem. Podbeuter comes with the newsbeuter
package, and features a look and feel very close to the one of newsbeuter. It
also shares the same configuration file.

Podcasts that have been downloaded but haven't been played yet remain in the
queue but are marked as downloaded. You can remove them by purging them from
the queue with the 'P' key. After you've played a file and close podbeuter, it
will be removed from the queue. The downloaded file remains on the
filesystem.
